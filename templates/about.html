          Hello Everyone ! <br> <br>
          A full time nerd and a coding enthusiast. I do things that I don't know how to. I have been doing projects related to web development and data science. I solve problems. I love to innovate and work with new technologies. I am also interested in calculus and statistical analysis, and mathematical modelling </p>
          </div>
          <p>
          Considering technical stuff, I know Python specific technologies including Flask and Django, Vue JS, jQuery, C++ and java.
          I have got a handful experience in frontend development and and am interested in working with backend technologies. I have also been mentoring people helping them in code via various platforms.
          </p>
          <p> 
          I am trying to minimise my entropy and help the universe be stable in my own way. Trying to make a dent in a specific way.
          <br>
          As I'm still a 16 exploring various dimensions of interests I have tried a few other works including translation( in French and German ), transcripting, blogging, photoshop, inkspace, etc.
          <hr>
          Also proficient in public speaking, management,  economics, statistics ( Machine Learning enthusiast ), human psychology, also explored the world of medicines and other medical drugs.
          </p>
          <p>
          Also for a fact, I'm currently working on how we can use smoke as a fuel. If you're interested in having the research work with me do give me a message.
          </p>
          <p>
          By this you know me as a full time nerd. Just to add up I love Mathematics and Chemistry. Also, we can only be friend if you believe that thea riemann hypothesis is true. In the end I solve problems, just get me something worth the time !
